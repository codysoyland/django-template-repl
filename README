django-template-repl is a readline shell for the Django template language.
It is similar to a CPython shell but it interprets template code instead of
Python. It can be invoked either as a management command or with a templatetag.

To install, add 'template_repl' to your settings.INSTALLED_APPS.

The management command gives you quick access to the shell:
    python manage.py templateshell

You can pass a url to the management command to assume the context of a specific location:
    python manage.py templateshell -u /admin/foo/bar/

You can also provide context directly with a command line option. Here is
an example of an interactive session:
    $ python manage.py templateshell -c "{'foo': 'FOO', 'bar': True}"
    >>> {% if bar %}
    ... {{ foo }}
    ... {% endif %}
    FOO
    >>>

In addition, you can use the repl templatetag which creates a REPL that assumes the
context of the caller template. This is basically "PDB for templates":
    {% load repl %}{% repl %}
